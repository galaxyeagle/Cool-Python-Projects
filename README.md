1. [Pangram Detector](/pangram_detector.py) : A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. Eg."The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram.
2. [Guess Game](/guess_game.py) : A simple 2-layer neural net is used to take input tensor having normalized guess and range midpoint and output a tensor with new guess. The loss is computed using MSELoss() function with adjusted targets based on user feedback at each iteration. The RMSProp optimizer is used for learning. If you think of any number between 1 and 100, the NN will narrow down within 20 iterations. However it's just for fun & illustrating a NN. You can actually narrow down within log2(100) = 7 iterations if you use binary serach algorithm !
